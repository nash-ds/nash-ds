# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Nash

Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering student from Fr Conceicao Rodrigues College of engineering, Bandra.

## What I do
- Building small-but-useful web apps with **Java**, **Python**, **Flask**, and **Spring Boot**  
- Messing with **ML/AI** until my laptop sounds like itâ€™s about to take flight  
- Working with databases like **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL**

## What Iâ€™m Learning Right Now
- **Spring Boot** 
- Writing code that doesnâ€™t make me question my life choices later
- Build something so good that *other people* actually use it (and maybe even like it)
