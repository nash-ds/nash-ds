# 👋 Hey, I’m Nash

I’m a Computer Engineering student who spends way too much time poking around with code, trying out new tech, and occasionally breaking things just to see how they work (don’t worry, I fix them… eventually 😅).

## What I do
- Building small-but-useful web apps with **Java**, **Python**, **Flask**, and **Spring Boot**  
- Messing with **ML/AI** until my laptop sounds like it’s about to take flight  
- Working with databases like **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL**

## Some Stuff I’ve Made
- 🧘 **Yoga Pose Detection & Correction System** – Real-time feedback using **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and a modular ML approach  
- 🏦 **Banking App** – Java Swing + MySQL, with accounts, transactions, and balance checks  
- 🚨 **Disaster Management System** – SOS alerts, live GPS tracking, and disaster news updates  


## What I’m Learning Right Now
- **Spring Boot** 
- Leveling up my **DSA** skills
- Figuring out how to architect applications without overcomplicating them
- Writing code that doesn’t make me question my life choices later
- Build something so good that *other people* actually use it (and maybe even like it)
